# E-Commerce App Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the bug fixes, security enhancements, and feature improvements made to the e-commerce application.

---

## Critical Bug Fixes

### 1. **Authentication Bug in Checkout** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Users couldn't complete orders even when logged in because the checkout page didn't send authentication tokens to the API.

**Solution:**
- Added Bearer token to checkout API requests ([app/checkout/page.tsx:67](app/checkout/page.tsx#L67))
- Implemented proper authentication state checking
- Added automatic redirect to login if not authenticated

### 2. **Dark Mode Flash Issue** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Page would flash with wrong theme on initial load.

**Solution:**
- Added inline script in HTML head to set theme before render ([app/layout.tsx:26-37](app/layout.tsx#L26-L37))
- Implemented localStorage persistence for theme preference
- Added system preference detection

### 2. **Input Sanitization** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Added XSS protection by sanitizing user inputs
- Removed dangerous characters (`<`, `>`)
